$ ssh-keygen -y -f "C:/Users/Pankaja K M/Downloads/key11.pem" > "C:/Users/Pankaja K M/Downloads/key11.pub"

âœ… You're in! Great job troubleshooting.

ðŸ”‘ Summary of what happened:
You were trying to SSH using the wrong username: ubuntu

But your EC2 instance is running Amazon Linux 2, which uses the default user ec2-user

Once you switched to:

bash

ssh -i ~/.ssh/key11.pem -o IdentitiesOnly=yes ec2-user@44.201.212.220

ðŸ”“ The key was accepted and login succeeded.

âœ… Quick Notes for Future Reference
AMI Type	Default SSH Username
Amazon Linux 2	ec2-user
Ubuntu	ubuntu
CentOS	centos
RHEL	ec2-user
Debian	admin or debian
